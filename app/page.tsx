        visually appealing web applications. I’ve worked with technologies like Next.js, 
        Tailwind CSS, and React Native on projects ranging from multi-step onboarding 
        processes to interactive portfolios. I’m skilled in organizing code, optimizing 
        components, and creating seamless user interfaces. I’m always eager to learn and
